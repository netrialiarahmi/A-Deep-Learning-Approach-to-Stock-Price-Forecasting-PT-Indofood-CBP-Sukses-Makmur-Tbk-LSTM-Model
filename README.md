# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Stock-Price-Forecasting-PT-Indofood-CBP-Sukses-Makmur-Tbk-LSTM-Model
This repository contains code for implementing an LSTM model to predict stock prices for PT Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur Tbk. The model is trained on historical stock prices and can be used to make predictions for future prices.

The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is widely used for processing time series data. LSTM is particularly effective in handling complex issues in time series data such as nonlinear trends, repetitive patterns, and long-term interactions between variables in the dataset.

The primary function of the LSTM algorithm in time series data is to predict future values. LSTM is capable of identifying patterns and trends in time series data and using them to estimate future values. As a result, LSTM is widely used for various prediction applications, including stock price prediction, weather prediction, and sales prediction.

LSTM is also used for time series data analysis, including identifying outliers, correlation between variables, and short-term and long-term forecasting. In this regard, LSTM can help stakeholders make better business decisions based on accurate and reliable time series data analysis.

Overall, LSTM is a powerful algorithm that can effectively process complex time series data and provide accurate and reliable prediction results. Therefore, LSTM has become a popular choice for practitioners and researchers who want to analyze and predict time series data.
